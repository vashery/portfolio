## about me
Hello! My name is Luke McCray. I am a technology enthusiast and all around computer guy. I
            have worked in the technology field for around 10 years and love to learn new things and expand my
            knowledge. I
            enjoy spending time with my family, pets, and playing retro style video games. I consider myself a very
            open person and enjoy being around all kinds of people. I like to give others the benefit of the doubt and
            am
            very optimistic.
